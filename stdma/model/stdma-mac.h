   * is a replacement of the ns3::WifiMac class and can be to compare CSMA-based periodic broadcasting in VANETs against STDMA-based periodic broadcasting in VANETs.
   *
   * Self-organized TDMA is an alternative to CSMA and was invented by H{\aa}kan Lans. STDMA employs a reservation scheme where nodes announce their next
   * transmissions, resulting in less random elements compared to CSMA. The STDMA approach has been standardized and is used both in the Automatic Identification
   * System (AIS) as well as in VDL Mode 4 to exchange positioning information between ships and aircrafts, respectively.

  /**
   * \brief An implementation of the MAC protocol Self-Organizing TDMA for the usage in 802.11p environments.
   *
   * This class encapsulates all the STDMA MAC functionality for periodic broadcasting. The STDMA medium access control
   * protocol is described in ITU-R M.1371-4 "Technical Characteristics for an Automatic Identification System Using Time Division
   * Multiple Access in the VHF Maritime Mobile Band", 2010. The protocol employs a TDMA-based approach and divides the time
   * in so called frames that last for a certain duration, and those frames into equally sized transmission slots that
   * accommodate a single packet transmission. The lifetime of a station in STDMA is divided into four different phases:
   * (1) initialization, (2) network entry, (3) first frame, and (4) continuous operation. These phases ensure that each station
   * first obtains an understanding of the slot allocation status, then announces its presence to the network, and finally
   * performs the initial slot allocation for all transmissions to be made during one frame. Afterwards, the continuous operation
   * phase is entered in which only slot re-allocations are carried out.
   *
   * It is required to use a report rate > 1 Hz to achieve valid operation. Unicast packets
   * are also not supported and simply "ignored" at the time being.
